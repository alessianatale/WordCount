Lawn in front of the terrace at Hunstanton.
[Sir John and Lady Caroline Pontefract, Miss Worsley, on chairs under
large yew tree.]
LADY CAROLINE. I believe this is the first English country house you
have stayed at, Miss Worsley?
HESTER. Yes, Lady Caroline.
LADY CAROLINE. You have no country houses, I am told, in America?
HESTER. We have not many.
LADY CAROLINE. Have you any country? What we should call
country?
HESTER. [Smiling.] We have the largest country in the world, Lady
Caroline. They used to tell us at school that some of our states are as big as
France and England put together.
LADY CAROLINE. Ah! you must find it very draughty, I should fancy.
[To Sir John.] John, you should have your muffler. What is the use of my
always knitting mufflers for you if you won’t wear them?
SIR JOHN. I am quite warm, Caroline, I assure you.
LADY CAROLINE. I think not, John. Well, you couldn’t come to a more
charming place than this, Miss Worsley, though the house is excessively damp,
quite unpardonably damp, and dear Lady Hunstanton is sometimes a little lax
about the people she asks down here. [To Sir John.] Jane mixes too much.
Lord Illingworth, of course, is a man of high distinction. It is a privilege to
meet him. And that member of Parliament, Mr. Kettle—
SIR JOHN. Kelvil, my love, Kelvil.
LADY CAROLINE. He must be quite respectable. One has never heard
his name before in the whole course of one’s life, which speaks volumes for a
man, nowadays. But Mrs. Allonby is hardly a very suitable person.
HESTER. I dislike Mrs. Allonby. I dislike her more than I can say.
LADY CAROLINE. I am not sure, Miss Worsley, that foreigners like
yourself should cultivate likes or dislikes about the people they are invited to
meet. Mrs. Allonby is very well born. She is a niece of Lord Brancaster’s. It
is said, of course, that she ran away twice before she was married. But you
know how unfair people often are. I myself don’t believe she ran away more
than once.
HESTER. Mr. Arbuthnot is very charming.
LADY CAROLINE. Ah, yes! the young man who has a post in a bank.
Lady Hunstanton is most kind in asking him here, and Lord Illingworth seems
to have taken quite a fancy to him. I am not sure, however, that Jane is right in
taking him out of his position. In my young days, Miss Worsley, one never
met any one in society who worked for their living. It was not considered the
thing.
HESTER. In America those are the people we respect most.
LADY CAROLINE. I have no doubt of it.
HESTER. Mr. Arbuthnot has a beautiful nature! He is so simple, so
sincere. He has one of the most beautiful natures I have ever come across. It
is a privilege to meet him.
LADY CAROLINE. It is not customary in England, Miss Worsley, for a
young lady to speak with such enthusiasm of any person of the opposite sex.
English women conceal their feelings till after they are married. They show
them then.
HESTER. Do you, in England, allow no friendship to exist between a
young man and a young girl?
[Enter Lady Hunstanton, followed by Footman with shawls and a cushion.]
LADY CAROLINE. We think it very inadvisable. Jane, I was just saying
what a pleasant party you have asked us to meet. You have a wonderful power
of selection. It is quite a gift.
LADY HUNSTANTON. Dear Caroline, how kind of you! I think we all
do fit in very nicely together. And I hope our charming American visitor will
carry back pleasant recollections of our English country life. [To Footman.]
The cushion, there, Francis. And my shawl. The Shetland. Get the Shetland.
[Exit Footman for shawl.]
[Enter Gerald Arbuthnot.]
GERALD. Lady Hunstanton, I have such good news to tell you. Lord
Illingworth has just offered to make me his secretary.
LADY HUNSTANTON. His secretary? That is good news indeed,
Gerald. It means a very brilliant future in store for you. Your dear mother
will be delighted. I really must try and induce her to come up here to-night.
Do you think she would, Gerald? I know how difficult it is to get her to go
anywhere.
GERALD. Oh! I am sure she would, Lady Hunstanton, if she knew Lord
Illingworth had made me such an offer.
[Enter Footman with shawl.]
LADY HUNSTANTON. I will write and tell her about it, and ask her to
come up and meet him. [To Footman.] Just wait, Francis. [Writes letter.]
LADY CAROLINE. That is a very wonderful opening for so young a man
as you are, Mr. Arbuthnot.
GERALD. It is indeed, Lady Caroline. I trust I shall be able to show
myself worthy of it.
LADY CAROLINE. I trust so.
GERALD. [To Hester.] You have not congratulated me yet, Miss
Worsley.
HESTER. Are you very pleased about it?
GERALD. Of course I am. It means everything to me—things that were
out of the reach of hope before may be within hope’s reach now.
HESTER. Nothing should be out of the reach of hope. Life is a hope.
LADY HUNSTANTON. I fancy, Caroline, that Diplomacy is what Lord
Illingworth is aiming at. I heard that he was offered Vienna. But that may not
be true.
LADY CAROLINE. I don’t think that England should be represented
abroad by an unmarried man, Jane. It might lead to complications.
LADY HUNSTANTON. You are too nervous, Caroline. Believe me, you
are too nervous. Besides, Lord Illingworth may marry any day. I was in
hopes he would have married lady Kelso. But I believe he said her family was
too large. Or was it her feet? I forget which. I regret it very much. She was
made to be an ambassador’s wife.
LADY CAROLINE. She certainly has a wonderful faculty of
remembering people’s names, and forgetting their faces.
LADY HUNSTANTON. Well, that is very natural, Caroline, is it not? [To
Footman.] Tell Henry to wait for an answer. I have written a line to your dear
mother, Gerald, to tell her your good news, and to say she really must come to
dinner.
[Exit Footman.]
GERALD. That is awfully kind of you, Lady Hunstanton. [To Hester.]
Will you come for a stroll, Miss Worsley?
HESTER. With pleasure. [Exit with Gerald.]
LADY HUNSTANTON. I am very much gratified at Gerald Arbuthnot’s
good fortune. He is quite a protégé of mine. And I am particularly pleased
that Lord Illingworth should have made the offer of his own accord without
my suggesting anything. Nobody likes to be asked favours. I remember poor
Charlotte Pagden making herself quite unpopular one season, because she had
a French governess she wanted to recommend to every one.
LADY CAROLINE. I saw the governess, Jane. Lady Pagden sent her to
me. It was before Eleanor came out. She was far too good-looking to be in
any respectable household. I don’t wonder Lady Pagden was so anxious to get
rid of her.
LADY HUNSTANTON. Ah, that explains it.
LADY CAROLINE. John, the grass is too damp for you. You had better
go and put on your overshoes at once.
SIR JOHN. I am quite comfortable, Caroline, I assure you.
LADY CAROLINE. You must allow me to be the best judge of that, John.
Pray do as I tell you.
[Sir John gets up and goes off.]
LADY HUNSTANTON. You spoil him, Caroline, you do indeed!
[Enter Mrs. Allonby and Lady Stutfield.]
[To MRS. ALLONBY.] Well, dear, I hope you like the park. It is said to
be well timbered.
MRS. ALLONBY. The trees are wonderful, Lady Hunstanton.
LADY STUTFIELD. Quite, quite wonderful.
MRS. ALLONBY. But somehow, I feel sure that if I lived in the country
for six months, I should become so unsophisticated that no one would take the
slightest notice of me.
LADY HUNSTANTON. I assure you, dear, that the country has not that
effect at all. Why, it was from Melthorpe, which is only two miles from here,
that Lady Belton eloped with Lord Fethersdale. I remember the occurrence
perfectly. Poor Lord Belton died three days afterwards of joy, or gout. I
forget which. We had a large party staying here at the time, so we were all
very much interested in the whole affair.
MRS. ALLONBY. I think to elope is cowardly. It’s running away from
danger. And danger has become so rare in modern life.
LADY CAROLINE. As far as I can make out, the young women of the
present day seem to make it the sole object of their lives to be always playing
with fire.
MRS. ALLONBY. The one advantage of playing with fire, LADY
CAROLINE, is that one never gets even singed. It is the people who don’t
know how to play with it who get burned up.
LADY STUTFIELD. Yes; I see that. It is very, very helpful.
LADY HUNSTANTON. I don’t know how the world would get on with
such a theory as that, dear Mrs. Allonby.
LADY STUTFIELD. Ah! The world was made for men and not for
women.
MRS. ALLONBY. Oh, don’t say that, Lady Stutfield. We have a much
better time than they have. There are far more things forbidden to us than are
forbidden to them.
LADY STUTFIELD. Yes; that is quite, quite true. I had not thought of
that.
[Enter Sir John and Mr. Kelvil.]
LADY HUNSTANTON. Well, Mr. Kelvil, have you got through your
work?
KELVIL. I have finished my writing for the day, Lady Hunstanton. It has
been an arduous task. The demands on the time of a public man are very
heavy nowadays, very heavy indeed. And I don’t think they meet with
adequate recognition.
LADY CAROLINE. John, have you got your overshoes on?
SIR JOHN. Yes, my love.
LADY CAROLINE. I think you had better come over here, John. It is
more sheltered.
SIR JOHN. I am quite comfortable, Caroline.
LADY CAROLINE. I think not, John. You had better sit beside me. [Sir
John rises and goes across.]
LADY STUTFIELD. And what have you been writing about this
morning, Mr. KELVIL?
KELVIL. On the usual subject, Lady Stutfield. On Purity.
LADY STUTFIELD. That must be such a very, very interesting thing to
write about.
KELVIL. It is the one subject of really national importance, nowadays,
Lady Stutfield. I purpose addressing my constituents on the question before
Parliament meets. I find that the poorer classes of this country display a
marked desire for a higher ethical standard.
LADY STUTFIELD. How quite, quite nice of them.
LADY CAROLINE. Are you in favour of women taking part in politics,
Mr. Kettle?
SIR JOHN. Kelvil, my love, Kelvil.
KELVIL. The growing influence of women is the one reassuring thing in
our political life, Lady Caroline. Women are always on the side of morality,
public and private.
LADY STUTFIELD. It is so very, very gratifying to hear you say that.
LADY HUNSTANTON. Ah, yes!—the moral qualities in women—that is
the important thing. I am afraid, Caroline, that dear Lord Illingworth doesn’t
value the moral qualities in women as much as he should.
[Enter Lord Illingworth.]
LADY STUTFIELD. The world says that Lord Illingworth is very, very
wicked.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. But what world says that, Lady Stutfield? It
must be the next world. This world and I are on excellent terms. [Sits down
beside Mrs. Allonby.]
LADY STUTFIELD. Every one I know says you are very, very wicked.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. It is perfectly monstrous the way people go
about, nowadays, saying things against one behind one’s back that are
absolutely and entirely true.
LADY HUNSTANTON. Dear Lord Illingworth is quite hopeless, Lady
Stutfield. I have given up trying to reform him. It would take a Public
Company with a Board of Directors and a paid Secretary to do that. But you
have the secretary already, Lord Illingworth, haven’t you? Gerald Arbuthnot
has told us of his good fortune; it is really most kind of you.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. Oh, don’t say that, Lady Hunstanton. Kind is a
dreadful word. I took a great fancy to young Arbuthnot the moment I met
him, and he’ll be of considerable use to me in something I am foolish enough
to think of doing.
LADY HUNSTANTON. He is an admirable young man. And his mother
is one of my dearest friends. He has just gone for a walk with our pretty
American. She is very pretty, is she not?
LADY CAROLINE. Far too pretty. These American girls carry off all the
good matches. Why can’t they stay in their own country? They are always
telling us it is the Paradise of women.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. It is, Lady Caroline. That is why, like Eve, they
are so extremely anxious to get out of it.
LADY CAROLINE. Who are Miss Worsley’s parents?
LORD ILLINGWORTH. American women are wonderfully clever in
concealing their parents.
LADY HUNSTANTON. My dear Lord Illingworth, what do you mean?
Miss Worsley, Caroline, is an orphan. Her father was a very wealthy
millionaire or philanthropist, or both, I believe, who entertained my son quite
hospitably, when he visited Boston. I don’t know how he made his money,
originally.
KELVIL. I fancy in American dry goods.
LADY HUNSTANTON. What are American dry goods?
LORD ILLINGWORTH. American novels.
LADY HUNSTANTON. How very singular! . . . Well, from whatever
source her large fortune came, I have a great esteem for Miss Worsley. She
dresses exceedingly well. All Americans do dress well. They get their clothes
in Paris.
MRS. ALLONBY. They say, Lady Hunstanton, that when good
Americans die they go to Paris.
LADY HUNSTANTON. Indeed? And when bad Americans die, where
do they go to?
LORD ILLINGWORTH. Oh, they go to America.
KELVIL. I am afraid you don’t appreciate America, Lord Illingworth. It
is a very remarkable country, especially considering its youth.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. The youth of America is their oldest tradition. It
has been going on now for three hundred years. To hear them talk one would
imagine they were in their first childhood. As far as civilisation goes they are
in their second.
KELVIL. There is undoubtedly a great deal of corruption in American
politics. I suppose you allude to that?
LORD ILLINGWORTH. I wonder.
LADY HUNSTANTON. Politics are in a sad way everywhere, I am told.
They certainly are in England. Dear Mr. Cardew is ruining the country. I
wonder Mrs. Cardew allows him. I am sure, Lord Illingworth, you don’t think
that uneducated people should be allowed to have votes?
LORD ILLINGWORTH. I think they are the only people who should.
KELVIL. Do you take no side then in modern politics, Lord Illingworth?
LORD ILLINGWORTH. One should never take sides in anything, Mr.
KELVIL. Taking sides is the beginning of sincerity, and earnestness follows
shortly afterwards, and the human being becomes a bore. However, the House
of Commons really does very little harm. You can’t make people good by Act
of Parliament,—that is something.
KELVIL. You cannot deny that the House of Commons has always shown
great sympathy with the sufferings of the poor.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. That is its special vice. That is the special vice
of the age. One should sympathise with the joy, the beauty, the colour of life.
The less said about life’s sores the better, Mr. Kelvil.
KELVIL. Still our East End is a very important problem.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. Quite so. It is the problem of slavery. And we
are trying to solve it by amusing the slaves.
LADY HUNSTANTON. Certainly, a great deal may be done by means of
cheap entertainments, as you say, Lord Illingworth. Dear Dr. Daubeny, our
rector here, provides, with the assistance of his curates, really admirable
recreations for the poor during the winter. And much good may be done by
means of a magic lantern, or a missionary, or some popular amusement of that
kind.
LADY CAROLINE. I am not at all in favour of amusements for the poor,
Jane. Blankets and coals are sufficient. There is too much love of pleasure
amongst the upper classes as it is. Health is what we want in modern life. The
tone is not healthy, not healthy at all.
KELVIL. You are quite right, Lady Caroline.
LADY CAROLINE. I believe I am usually right.
MRS. ALLONBY. Horrid word ‘health.’
LORD ILLINGWORTH. Silliest word in our language, and one knows so
well the popular idea of health. The English country gentleman galloping
after a fox—the unspeakable in full pursuit of the uneatable.
KELVIL. May I ask, Lord Illingworth, if you regard the House of Lords as
a better institution than the House of Commons?
LORD ILLINGWORTH. A much better institution, of course. We in the
House of Lords are never in touch with public opinion. That makes us a
civilised body.
KELVIL. Are you serious in putting forward such a view?
LORD ILLINGWORTH. Quite serious, Mr. Kelvil. [To Mrs. Allonby.]
Vulgar habit that is people have nowadays of asking one, after one has given
them an idea, whether one is serious or not. Nothing is serious except passion.
The intellect is not a serious thing, and never has been. It is an instrument on
which one plays, that is all. The only serious form of intellect I know is the
British intellect. And on the British intellect the illiterates play the drum.
LADY HUNSTANTON. What are you saying, Lord Illingworth, about the
drum?
LORD ILLINGWORTH. I was merely talking to Mrs. Allonby about the
leading articles in the London newspapers.
LADY HUNSTANTON. But do you believe all that is written in the
newspapers?
LORD ILLINGWORTH. I do. Nowadays it is only the unreadable that
occurs. [Rises with Mrs. Allonby.]
LADY HUNSTANTON. Are you going, Mrs. Allonby?
MRS. ALLONBY. Just as far as the conservatory. Lord Illingworth told
me this morning that there was an orchid there as beautiful as the seven deadly
sins.
LADY HUNSTANTON. My dear, I hope there is nothing of the kind. I
will certainly speak to the gardener.
[Exit Mrs. Allonby and Lord Illingworth.]
LADY CAROLINE. Remarkable type, Mrs. Allonby.
LADY HUNSTANTON. She lets her clever tongue run away with her
sometimes.
LADY CAROLINE. Is that the only thing, Jane, Mrs. Allonby allows to
run away with her?
LADY HUNSTANTON. I hope so, Caroline, I am sure.
[Enter Lord Alfred.]
Dear Lord Alfred, do join us. [Lord Alfred sits down beside Lady
Stutfield.]
LADY CAROLINE. You believe good of every one, Jane. It is a great
fault.
LADY STUTFIELD. Do you really, really think, Lady Caroline, that one
should believe evil of every one?
LADY CAROLINE. I think it is much safer to do so, Lady Stutfield.
Until, of course, people are found out to be good. But that requires a great
deal of investigation nowadays.
LADY STUTFIELD. But there is so much unkind scandal in modern life.
LADY CAROLINE. Lord Illingworth remarked to me last night at dinner
that the basis of every scandal is an absolutely immoral certainty.
KELVIL. Lord Illingworth is, of course, a very brilliant man, but he seems
to me to be lacking in that fine faith in the nobility and purity of life which is
so important in this century.
LADY STUTFIELD. Yes, quite, quite important, is it not?
KELVIL. He gives me the impression of a man who does not appreciate
the beauty of our English home-life. I would say that he was tainted with
foreign ideas on the subject.
LADY STUTFIELD. There is nothing, nothing like the beauty of homelife, is there?
KELVIL. It is the mainstay of our moral system in England, Lady
Stutfield. Without it we would become like our neighbours.
LADY STUTFIELD. That would be so, so sad, would it not?
KELVIL. I am afraid, too, that Lord Illingworth regards woman simply as
a toy. Now, I have never regarded woman as a toy. Woman is the intellectual
helpmeet of man in public as in private life. Without her we should forget the
true ideals. [Sits down beside Lady Stutfield.]
LADY STUTFIELD. I am so very, very glad to hear you say that.
LADY CAROLINE. You a married man, Mr. Kettle?
SIR JOHN. Kelvil, dear, Kelvil.
KELVIL. I am married, Lady Caroline.
LADY CAROLINE. Family?
KELVIL. Yes.
LADY CAROLINE. How many?
KELVIL. Eight.
[Lady Stutfield turns her attention to Lord Alfred.]
LADY CAROLINE. Mrs. Kettle and the children are, I suppose, at the
seaside? [Sir John shrugs his shoulders.]
KELVIL. My wife is at the seaside with the children, Lady Caroline.
LADY CAROLINE. You will join them later on, no doubt?
KELVIL. If my public engagements permit me.
LADY CAROLINE. Your public life must be a great source of
gratification to Mrs. Kettle.
SIR JOHN. Kelvil, my love, Kelvil.
LADY STUTFIELD. [To Lord Alfred.] How very, very charming those
gold-tipped cigarettes of yours are, Lord Alfred.
LORD ALFRED. They are awfully expensive. I can only afford them
when I’m in debt.
LADY STUTFIELD. It must be terribly, terribly distressing to be in debt.
LORD ALFRED. One must have some occupation nowadays. If I hadn’t
my debts I shouldn’t have anything to think about. All the chaps I know are in
debt.
LADY STUTFIELD. But don’t the people to whom you owe the money
give you a great, great deal of annoyance?
[Enter Footman.]
LORD ALFRED. Oh, no, they write; I don’t.
LADY STUTFIELD. How very, very strange.
LADY HUNSTANTON. Ah, here is a letter, Caroline, from dear MRS.
ARBUTHNOT. She won’t dine. I am so sorry. But she will come in the
evening. I am very pleased indeed. She is one of the sweetest of women.
Writes a beautiful hand, too, so large, so firm. [Hands letter to Lady
Caroline.]
LADY CAROLINE. [Looking at it.] A little lacking in femininity, Jane.
Femininity is the quality I admire most in women.
LADY HUNSTANTON. [Taking back letter and leaving it on table.] Oh!
she is very feminine, Caroline, and so good too. You should hear what The
Archdeacon says of her. He regards her as his right hand in the parish.
[Footman speaks to her.] In the Yellow Drawing-room. Shall we all go in?
Lady Stutfield, shall we go in to tea?
LADY STUTFIELD. With pleasure, Lady Hunstanton. [They rise and
proceed to go off. Sir John offers to carry Lady Stutfield’s cloak.]
LADY CAROLINE. John! If you would allow your nephew to look after
Lady Stutfield’s cloak, you might help me with my workbasket.
[Enter Lord Illingworth and Mrs. Allonby.]
SIR JOHN. Certainly, my love. [Exeunt.]
MRS. ALLONBY. Curious thing, plain women are always jealous of their
husbands, beautiful women never are!
LORD ILLINGWORTH. Beautiful women never have time. They are
always so occupied in being jealous of other people’s husbands.
MRS. ALLONBY. I should have thought Lady Caroline would have
grown tired of conjugal anxiety by this time! Sir John is her fourth!
LORD ILLINGWORTH. So much marriage is certainly not becoming.
Twenty years of romance make a woman look like a ruin; but twenty years of
marriage make her something like a public building.
MRS. ALLONBY. Twenty years of romance! Is there such a thing?
LORD ILLINGWORTH. Not in our day. Women have become too
brilliant. Nothing spoils a romance so much as a sense of humour in the
woman.
MRS. ALLONBY. Or the want of it in the man.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. You are quite right. In a Temple every one
should be serious, except the thing that is worshipped.
MRS. ALLONBY. And that should be man?
LORD ILLINGWORTH. Women kneel so gracefully; men don’t.
MRS. ALLONBY. You are thinking of Lady Stutfield!
LORD ILLINGWORTH. I assure you I have not thought of Lady Stutfield
for the last quarter of an hour.
MRS. ALLONBY. Is she such a mystery?
LORD ILLINGWORTH. She is more than a mystery—she is a mood.
MRS. ALLONBY. Moods don’t last.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. It is their chief charm.
[Enter Hester and Gerald.]
GERALD. Lord Illingworth, every one has been congratulating me, Lady
Hunstanton and Lady Caroline, and . . . every one. I hope I shall make a good
secretary.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. You will be the pattern secretary, Gerald. [Talks
to him.]
MRS. ALLONBY. You enjoy country life, Miss Worsley?
HESTER. Very much indeed.
MRS. ALLONBY. Don’t find yourself longing for a London dinnerparty?
HESTER. I dislike London dinner-parties.
MRS. ALLONBY. I adore them. The clever people never listen, and the
stupid people never talk.
HESTER. I think the stupid people talk a great deal.
MRS. ALLONBY. Ah, I never listen!
LORD ILLINGWORTH. My dear boy, if I didn’t like you I wouldn’t have
made you the offer. It is because I like you so much that I want to have you
with me.
[Exit HESTER with GERALD.]
Charming fellow, Gerald Arbuthnot!
MRS. ALLONBY. He is very nice; very nice indeed. But I can’t stand the
American young lady.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. Why?
MRS. ALLONBY. She told me yesterday, and in quite a loud voice too,
that she was only eighteen. It was most annoying.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. One should never trust a woman who tells one
her real age. A woman who would tell one that, would tell one anything.
MRS. ALLONBY. She is a Puritan besides—
LORD ILLINGWORTH. Ah, that is inexcusable. I don’t mind plain
women being Puritans. It is the only excuse they have for being plain. But
she is decidedly pretty. I admire her immensely. [Looks steadfastly at MRS.
ALLONBY.]
MRS. ALLONBY. What a thoroughly bad man you must be!
LORD ILLINGWORTH. What do you call a bad man?
MRS. ALLONBY. The sort of man who admires innocence.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. And a bad woman?
MRS. ALLONBY. Oh! the sort of woman a man never gets tired of.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. You are severe—on yourself.
MRS. ALLONBY. Define us as a sex.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. Sphinxes without secrets.
MRS. ALLONBY. Does that include the Puritan women?
LORD ILLINGWORTH. Do you know, I don’t believe in the existence of
Puritan women? I don’t think there is a woman in the world who would not be
a little flattered if one made love to her. It is that which makes women so
irresistibly adorable.
MRS. ALLONBY. You think there is no woman in the world who would
object to being kissed?
LORD ILLINGWORTH. Very few.
MRS. ALLONBY. Miss Worsley would not let you kiss her.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. Are you sure?
MRS. ALLONBY. Quite.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. What do you think she’d do if I kissed her?
MRS. ALLONBY. Either marry you, or strike you across the face with
her glove. What would you do if she struck you across the face with her
glove?
LORD ILLINGWORTH. Fall in love with her, probably.
MRS. ALLONBY. Then it is lucky you are not going to kiss her!
LORD ILLINGWORTH. Is that a challenge?
MRS. ALLONBY. It is an arrow shot into the air.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. Don’t you know that I always succeed in
whatever I try?
MRS. ALLONBY. I am sorry to hear it. We women adore failures. They
lean on us.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. You worship successes. You cling to them.
MRS. ALLONBY. We are the laurels to hide their baldness.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. And they need you always, except at the
moment of triumph.
MRS. ALLONBY. They are uninteresting then.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. How tantalising you are! [A pause.]
MRS. ALLONBY. Lord Illingworth, there is one thing I shall always like
you for.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. Only one thing? And I have so many bad
qualities.
MRS. ALLONBY. Ah, don’t be too conceited about them. You may lose
them as you grow old.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. I never intend to grow old. The soul is born old
but grows young. That is the comedy of life.
MRS. ALLONBY. And the body is born young and grows old. That is
life’s tragedy.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. Its comedy also, sometimes. But what is the
mysterious reason why you will always like me?
MRS. ALLONBY. It is that you have never made love to me.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. I have never done anything else.
MRS. ALLONBY. Really? I have not noticed it.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. How fortunate! It might have been a tragedy for
both of us.
MRS. ALLONBY. We should each have survived.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. One can survive everything nowadays, except
death, and live down anything except a good reputation.
MRS. ALLONBY. Have you tried a good reputation?
LORD ILLINGWORTH. It is one of the many annoyances to which I
have never been subjected.
MRS. ALLONBY. It may come.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. Why do you threaten me?
MRS. ALLONBY. I will tell you when you have kissed the Puritan.
[Enter Footman.]
FRANCIS. Tea is served in the Yellow Drawing-room, my lord.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. Tell her ladyship we are coming in.
FRANCIS. Yes, my lord.
[Exit.]
LORD ILLINGWORTH. Shall we go in to tea?
MRS. ALLONBY. Do you like such simple pleasures?
LORD ILLINGWORTH. I adore simple pleasures. They are the last
refuge of the complex. But, if you wish, let us stay here. Yes, let us stay here.
The Book of Life begins with a man and a woman in a garden.
MRS. ALLONBY. It ends with Revelations.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. You fence divinely. But the button has come of
your foil.
MRS. ALLONBY. I have still the mask.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. It makes your eyes lovelier.
MRS. ALLONBY. Thank you. Come.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. [Sees MRS. ARBUTHNOT’s letter on table,
and takes it up and looks at envelope.] What a curious handwriting! It
reminds me of the handwriting of a woman I used to know years ago.
MRS. ALLONBY. Who?
LORD ILLINGWORTH. Oh! no one. No one in particular. A woman of
no importance. [Throws letter down, and passes up the steps of the terrace
with MRS. ALLONBY. They smile at each other.]
Act Drop.
SECOND ACT
SCENE
Drawing-room at Hunstanton, after dinner, lamps lit. Door L.C. Door R.C.
[Ladies seated on sofas.]
MRS. ALLONBY. What a comfort it is to have got rid of the men for a
little!
LADY STUTFIELD. Yes; men persecute us dreadfully, don’t they?
MRS. ALLONBY. Persecute us? I wish they did.
LADY HUNSTANTON. My dear!
MRS. ALLONBY. The annoying thing is that the wretches can be
perfectly happy without us. That is why I think it is every woman’s duty never
to leave them alone for a single moment, except during this short breathing
space after dinner; without which I believe we poor women would be
absolutely worn to shadows.
[Enter Servants with coffee.]
LADY HUNSTANTON. Worn to shadows, dear?
MRS. ALLONBY. Yes, Lady Hunstanton. It is such a strain keeping men
up to the mark. They are always trying to escape from us.
LADY STUTFIELD. It seems to me that it is we who are always trying to
escape from them. Men are so very, very heartless. They know their power
and use it.
LADY CAROLINE. [Takes coffee from Servant.] What stuff and
nonsense all this about men is! The thing to do is to keep men in their proper
place.
MRS. ALLONBY. But what is their proper place, Lady Caroline?
LADY CAROLINE. Looking after their wives, Mrs. Allonby.
MRS. ALLONBY. [Takes coffee from Servant.] Really? And if they’re
not married?
LADY CAROLINE. If they are not married, they should be looking after
a wife. It’s perfectly scandalous the amount of bachelors who are going about
society. There should be a law passed to compel them all to marry within
twelve months.
LADY STUTFIELD. [Refuses coffee.] But if they’re in love with some
one who, perhaps, is tied to another?
LADY CAROLINE. In that case, Lady Stutfield, they should be married
off in a week to some plain respectable girl, in order to teach them not to
meddle with other people’s property.
MRS. ALLONBY. I don’t think that we should ever be spoken of as other
people’s property. All men are married women’s property. That is the only
true definition of what married women’s property really is. But we don’t
belong to any one.
LADY STUTFIELD. Oh, I am so very, very glad to hear you say so.
LADY HUNSTANTON. But do you really think, dear Caroline, that
legislation would improve matters in any way? I am told that, nowadays, all
the married men live like bachelors, and all the bachelors like married men.
MRS. ALLONBY. I certainly never know one from the other.
LADY STUTFIELD. Oh, I think one can always know at once whether a
man has home claims upon his life or not. I have noticed a very, very sad
expression in the eyes of so many married men.
MRS. ALLONBY. Ah, all that I have noticed is that they are horribly
tedious when they are good husbands, and abominably conceited when they
are not.
LADY HUNSTANTON. Well, I suppose the type of husband has
completely changed since my young days, but I’m bound to state that poor
dear Hunstanton was the most delightful of creatures, and as good as gold.
MRS. ALLONBY. Ah, my husband is a sort of promissory note; I’m tired
of meeting him.
LADY CAROLINE. But you renew him from time to time, don’t you?
MRS. ALLONBY. Oh no, Lady Caroline. I have only had one husband as
yet. I suppose you look upon me as quite an amateur.
LADY CAROLINE. With your views on life I wonder you married at all.
MRS. ALLONBY. So do I.
LADY HUNSTANTON. My dear child, I believe you are really very
happy in your married life, but that you like to hide your happiness from
others.
MRS. ALLONBY. I assure you I was horribly deceived in Ernest.
LADY HUNSTANTON. Oh, I hope not, dear. I knew his mother quite
well. She was a Stratton, Caroline, one of Lord Crowland’s daughters.
LADY CAROLINE. Victoria Stratton? I remember her perfectly. A silly
fair-haired woman with no chin.
MRS. ALLONBY. Ah, Ernest has a chin. He has a very strong chin, a
square chin. Ernest’s chin is far too square.
LADY STUTFIELD. But do you really think a man’s chin can be too
square? I think a man should look very, very strong, and that his chin should
be quite, quite square.
MRS. ALLONBY. Then you should certainly know Ernest, Lady
Stutfield. It is only fair to tell you beforehand he has got no conversation at
all.
LADY STUTFIELD. I adore silent men.
MRS. ALLONBY. Oh, Ernest isn’t silent. He talks the whole time. But
he has got no conversation. What he talks about I don’t know. I haven’t
listened to him for years.
LADY STUTFIELD. Have you never forgiven him then? How sad that
seems! But all life is very, very sad, is it not?
MRS. ALLONBY. Life, Lady Stutfield, is simply a mauvais quart d’heure
made up of exquisite moments.
LADY STUTFIELD. Yes, there are moments, certainly. But was it
something very, very wrong that Mr. Allonby did? Did he become angry with
you, and say anything that was unkind or true?
MRS. ALLONBY. Oh dear, no. Ernest is invariably calm. That is one of
the reasons he always gets on my nerves. Nothing is so aggravating as
calmness. There is something positively brutal about the good temper of most
modern men. I wonder we women stand it as well as we do.
LADY STUTFIELD. Yes; men’s good temper shows they are not so
sensitive as we are, not so finely strung. It makes a great barrier often
between husband and wife, does it not? But I would so much like to know
what was the wrong thing Mr. Allonby did.
MRS. ALLONBY. Well, I will tell you, if you solemnly promise to tell
everybody else.
LADY STUTFIELD. Thank you, thank you. I will make a point of
repeating it.
MRS. ALLONBY. When Ernest and I were engaged, he swore to me
positively on his knees that he had never loved any one before in the whole
course of his life. I was very young at the time, so I didn’t believe him, I
needn’t tell you. Unfortunately, however, I made no enquiries of any kind till
after I had been actually married four or five months. I found out then that
what he had told me was perfectly true. And that sort of thing makes a man so
absolutely uninteresting.
LADY HUNSTANTON. My dear!
MRS. ALLONBY. Men always want to be a woman’s first love. That is
their clumsy vanity. We women have a more subtle instinct about things.
What we like is to be a man’s last romance.
LADY STUTFIELD. I see what you mean. It’s very, very beautiful.
LADY HUNSTANTON. My dear child, you don’t mean to tell me that
you won’t forgive your husband because he never loved any one else? Did
you ever hear such a thing, Caroline? I am quite surprised.
LADY CAROLINE. Oh, women have become so highly educated, Jane,
that nothing should surprise us nowadays, except happy marriages. They
apparently are getting remarkably rare.
MRS. ALLONBY. Oh, they’re quite out of date.
LADY STUTFIELD. Except amongst the middle classes, I have been told.
MRS. ALLONBY. How like the middle classes!
LADY STUTFIELD. Yes—is it not?—very, very like them.
LADY CAROLINE. If what you tell us about the middle classes is true,
Lady Stutfield, it redounds greatly to their credit. It is much to be regretted
that in our rank of life the wife should be so persistently frivolous, under the
impression apparently that it is the proper thing to be. It is to that I attribute
the unhappiness of so many marriages we all know of in society.
MRS. ALLONBY. Do you know, Lady Caroline, I don’t think the
frivolity of the wife has ever anything to do with it. More marriages are ruined
nowadays by the common sense of the husband than by anything else. How
can a woman be expected to be happy with a man who insists on treating her
as if she were a perfectly rational being?
LADY HUNSTANTON. My dear!
MRS. ALLONBY. Man, poor, awkward, reliable, necessary man belongs
to a sex that has been rational for millions and millions of years. He can’t help
himself. It is in his race. The History of Woman is very different. We have
always been picturesque protests against the mere existence of common sense.
We saw its dangers from the first.
LADY STUTFIELD. Yes, the common sense of husbands is certainly
most, most trying. Do tell me your conception of the Ideal Husband. I think it
would be so very, very helpful.
MRS. ALLONBY. The Ideal Husband? There couldn’t be such a thing.
The institution is wrong.
LADY STUTFIELD. The Ideal Man, then, in his relations to us.
LADY CAROLINE. He would probably be extremely realistic.
Mrs. Caroline. The Ideal Man! Oh, the Ideal Man should talk to us as if
we were goddesses, and treat us as if we were children. He should refuse all
our serious requests, and gratify every one of our whims. He should
encourage us to have caprices, and forbid us to have missions. He should
always say much more than he means, and always mean much more than he
says.
LADY HUNSTANTON. But how could he do both, dear?
MRS. ALLONBY. He should never run down other pretty women. That
would show he had no taste, or make one suspect that he had too much. No;
he should be nice about them all, but say that somehow they don’t attract him.
LADY STUTFIELD. Yes, that is always very, very pleasant to hear about
other women.
MRS. ALLONBY. If we ask him a question about anything, he should
give us an answer all about ourselves. He should invariably praise us for
whatever qualities he knows we haven’t got. But he should be pitiless, quite
pitiless, in reproaching us for the virtues that we have never dreamed of
possessing. He should never believe that we know the use of useful things.
That would be unforgiveable. But he should shower on us everything we
don’t want.
